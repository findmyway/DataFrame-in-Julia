# DataFrame in Julia

## Background

Back to 2013, I learned Python for the first time. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) was one of the most attractive libraries (also one of the most complicate libraries) that I encontered. I used to spend a lot of time reading the whole [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) but got lost in too many specific details. And one day I found a repo named [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook), which was very intuitive and friendly to beginners in Python. I really apperated the author's work and then translated it into Chinese [here](https://github.com/ia-cas/pandas-cookbook).

Recently, my interest has shifted to [Julialang](https://julialang.org/) (happened to found that the author of [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook) also named Julia). The most attractive feature of Julia is the lisp-like macros and the high performance in computation. Here I rewrite most of the examples from [pandas-cookbook](https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook) into Julia. This repo is a homage to [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/). Hope it is helpful to those who are new to Julia.
